## Purpose of this repo
As my interest in Machine Learning grows, I will collect resources here for my journey as I dive deeper into everything ML related. Here I plan to share books, online resources, and maybe tutorials and projects that I attempt as I learn the subject myself. Currently, I am still learning as much as I can about the math behind the models, and hope to write my own implementation of them in the future. Additionally, I may include some resources on LLMs here, as I am working on a project involving Langchain.

### Books
- Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow
  - Great overall book on machine learning. I found that it covers all areas, but not as deep as I would've liked it to. Great for applications and         introduction to the subject though.

### Online Resources
- Song Han's <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFvPEQTxKI&list=PL80kAHvQbh-pT4lCkDT53zT8DKmhE0idB">EfficientML.ai course</a>, taught at MIT
  - This course really helped me dive deeper into CNNs, pruning, and quantization. Professor Song Han really explained the material well. More on this   later.
