# CSDS 340 : Intro to Machine Learning

This is my repository for the Intro to Machine Learning (f24) course taught by Kevin Xu.

Here, I have my various homework, a spam classifier project, and several markdowns containing intro-level notes on various aspects of machine learning.

Here is my recommended "path" for going through the repository:
1. Classification
2. 
3. Evaluation Metrics
