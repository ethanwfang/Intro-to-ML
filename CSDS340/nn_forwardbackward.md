### Neural Networks
#### Single vs. multi-layer neural networks
- Single NN can only learn linear decision boundaries (perceptron)
- Multi-layer NN works by stacking together multiple single layer

#### Multi-layer Perceptron
- Uses differentiable activation functions instead of thresholds, so you can use gradient descent weights in each layer

Forward propagation: inference. Inference is the propagation patternsf
